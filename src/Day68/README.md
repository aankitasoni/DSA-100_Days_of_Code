<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-containing-character/">2942. Find Words Containing Character</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array of strings <code>words</code> and a character <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>an <strong>array of indices</strong> representing the words that contain the character </em><code>x</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the returned array may be in <strong>any</strong> order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "e" occurs in both words: "l<strong><u>ee</u></strong>t", and "cod<u><strong>e</strong></u>". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "a" occurs in "<strong><u>a</u></strong>bc", and "<u><strong>aaaa</strong></u>". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.

<h2><a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/">2390. Removing Stars From a String</a><hr>
</h2>

You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.


Example 1:

Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
  There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
  Example 2:

Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
